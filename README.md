# Quick facts about me:
- üëã Hi there, I am Alex Chu, studying in a Computer Science diploma.
- üå± I am new to coding and it is interesting to me.
- üíûÔ∏è I can't live without a computer. Feel free to connect me in linkedin or wherever you could find me!

# Self intro
In addition to the quick facts above, my path to Web Dev is from plain HTML + some JS then to web design, built my own servers with LAMP and LEMP stacks and built some websites for clients in my freelance work.

I was another type of "fullstack" in terms of webdesign + some coding + server deployment. Now after I am back to school and learning new things, I am a real fullstack web developer.

I have experiences with HTML + CSS + PHP + JavaScript, and now I am working on Node.js, React.js and Next.js. Once I finish school or I can squeeze some times from piles of assignments and schoolworks, I really look forward to rebuild my website with some portfolios.

I am open to projects and some volunteer works which is meaningful, feel free to contact me!
