# Self intro
In addition to the quick facts above, my path to Web Dev is from plain HTML + some JS then to web design, built my own servers with LAMP and LEMP stacks and built some websites for clients in my freelance work.

I was another type of "fullstack" in terms of webdesign + some coding + server deployment. Now after I am back to school and learning new things, I am a real fullstack web developer.

I have experiences with HTML + CSS + PHP + JavaScript, and now I am working on Node.js, React.js and Next.js. Once I finish school or I can squeeze some times from piles of assignments and schoolworks, I really look forward to rebuild my website with some portfolios.

I am open to projects and some volunteer works which is meaningful, feel free to contact me!

Apology that I haven't got time to rebuild my website, right now I have put my web assignment in these links before:

https://a3.alexchu414.uk - A Game Rental shop, which uses Express Handlebars and Node.js, without using real databases to mimic the manipulatation.

https://a4.alexchu414.uk - A website to play some Youtube Videos. This assignment is to demostrate our javascript skills as well as the MongoDB skills we have learnt. It has a simple admin backend which does not require login to show the comments and like amount, also an option to delete each video together with the comments. Once every data is deleted, the system will import the default showcase data again so feel free to delete anything!

https://a5.alexchu414.uk - This "Gym" website is to mimic a gym booking site. It showcase the knowledge of authorization and authenication. It uses session to identify users and visitors and some options are only available to users who have signed in.
